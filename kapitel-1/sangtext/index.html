  <h1>Nasty</h1>

  <h2>Lyrics</h2>

  <p>I been a nasty girl, nasty
    I been a nasty girl, nasty <br>
    I been a nasty girl, nasty <br>
    I been a nasty, nasty, nasty</p>

  <p>Is somebody gonna match my freak?
    Is somebody gonna match my freak?
    Is somebody gonna match my nasty?
    I got stamina, they say I'm a athlete <br>
    Is somebody gonna match my freak?
    Need somebody with a good technique
    Is somebody gonna match my nasty?
    Pillow talking got my throat raspy</p>

  <p>If you keep up with me
    I'll keep on coming back
    If you do it too good
    I'm gonna get attached
    'Cause it feels like heaven when it hurts so bad
    Baby, put it on me <br>
    I like it just like that
    Just like that</p>

  <p> I been a nasty girl, nasty
    I been a nasty girl, nasty (just like that)
    I been a nasty girl, nasty
    I been a nasty, nasty, nasty (I like it just like that)</p>

  <p> I been a nasty girl, nasty
    I been a nasty girl, nasty (just like that)
    I been a nasty girl, nasty
    I been a nasty, nasty, nasty</p>
